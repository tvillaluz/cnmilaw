# Purpose
Creates a big PDFs of the CNMI law, separated by Title, so you can peruse with your built-in scroll functions and not have to keep jumping back to tree-view for the next section.

# How it does it...
Downloads large qty (7000+) small pdf sections and groups them by title. 
The order from website is assumed to be correct and uses that order to join the multiple pdf into a single large PDF for each title.

# Disclaimer
This is only for reference. 
DO NOT PRINT this out and bring it to court and use it to site references.. you will just piss off the judge.
